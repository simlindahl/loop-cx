# Run the first Android build on Windows

Install .NET SDK 10.0.100 (x64), JDK 21 and Android Studio. Set JAVA_HOME to your JDK and ANDROID_HOME to your Android SDK. Install Android SDK Platform 36, Build Tools 36.0.0 and Platform Tools in SDK Manager. Add platform-tools to PATH. Create a Pixel emulator with Google APIs API 35 and x86_64 in Device Manager and start it.

Run in PowerShell from the repository root, with the emulator as the only connected device.

```powershell
adb devices
dotnet workload install maui-android
dotnet build src/LoopCx/LoopCx.csproj -t:Run -c Debug -p:RuntimeIdentifier=android-x64
```

The home screen should show **Start a run**. This verifies the path from Android startup to a rendered Razor component. GitHub Actions builds a debug-signed x64 APK and tests the same heading through Android's accessibility tree. The APK is available in the run's artifacts.

This first check covers app startup. GPS with a locked screen, WHOOP over BLE, audio and Health Connect are tracked in issue #1. The Windows commands also still need to be tested on Windows.
